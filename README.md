Raspberry Pi Weather Base Station

PiWeather is a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) based weather base 
station.   The basic goal is to provide a graphing, reporting and alerting 
solution for wireless weather (temperature, humidity, rain, wind) sensors 
sold by companies like [La Cross Technology](http://www.lacrossetechnology.com/).

PiWeather will be comprised of two parts:

1. Software which can run on any Linux computer 

2. A RaspberryPi daughter board providing the wireless RF connectivity to the sensors

While the software will be designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, it is intended that it 
can run on any Linux computer with a USB port and a [JeeLink](http://jeelabs.net/projects/hardware/wiki/JeeLink)
